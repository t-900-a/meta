# Driving the Monero ecosystem forward.


### Illiciting feedback is reliant on reddit and stackexchange. 

Reddit blocks tor and has continued to tighten it's ecosystem.
Once the feedback is collected, there is no mechanism in which users can voice priorities. Sometimes the feedback becomes tribal knowledge.
But, the posts are often forgotten or burried and sometimes being brought-up repeatedly. Low signal to noise; no economics at play, as posting and commenting is free.


### Why not just use the gitlab css?

Intended to request funding / illicit feedback for specific deliverables and is not intended for users to illicit feedback. 
It is also a push mechanism, meaning the CSS doesn't attract developers who are looking for work. 
It attracts developers who already know about Monero and have an idea.

### Why not just use github issues?

Monero Core has locked github issues down to contributors, users cannot provide input.
Other Monero related repositories are scattered and new Monero devs have a hard time finding projects that have github issues / feature requests that need worked on.

### Why not just use forum.getmonero.org?

It's abandoned and the ideas there came from people who were asking for funding directly.

### Why not just use gitcoin?

Monero is not supported on gitcoin and relies on github issues.

### Plan for growth

With additional ecosystem growth involving other chains' teams, it will be important for those teams to have an avenue to request assistance in building out common good open source code.

## No bounty system exists for Monero protocol, feature, or ecosystem projects.
* Hackerone is only for vulnerabilities. 

### Why bounties?

Prioritization occurs via economic incentives and not "noise" from the community.


### What's the solution? 

Open source feedback system: https://getfider.com/

Develop bot for Fider to document "economic incentives" via Monero
Every post that is created will have a comment added by the bot that provides a subaddress from core that will act as the "bounty" for that feature / project / idea.
For every donation to that subaddress, the bot will leave a comment that includes the new transaction and the total amount raised.
A human would have to be involved for moderating the site and to make payments when an ecosystem contribution is completed.
The spam issue that was seen with github issues could be mitigated, by requiring an xmr micropayment per post.
A policy would have to be established that defines what is done with bounties that become stale.
